Git commits will follow a specific pattern of [type]([branch suffix]): [short change description].

## Examples

1. A file was modified in branch fix/meta, fixing an axios connection issue.
   commit message:

   > "fix(meta): fix axios connection failure"

2. A piece of code in branch dev was refactored to work with a new library.
   commit message:

   > "refactor(dev): refactor form to use zod"

3. A styling issue in branch feat/comments was adjusted

   > "style(comments): fix button positioning"

## Rules

1. Keep messages concise
2. Keep commits atomic
3. If unsure about how to format a commit message, check git logs.
4. if unsure after checking git logs, confirm with user and list numbered formatting options that you think might be valid.
5. NEVER change code, run lints or do any operation that could change code before commiting without user permission. Git requests should never alter code in any way whatsoever unless requested.
6. You can prefix the commit description with emojis describing the changes, but it is not required and undesirable if no emoji is sufficiently descriptive of the change.
